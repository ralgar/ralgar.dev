I am *Ryan Algar* - a highly motivated, self-taught programmer and Linux sysadmin who specializes in Cloud Native technologies and DevOps methodology.

I am particularly enthusiastic about automation tools and actively engage in the open source community, regularly contributing to a wide variety of projects. My strong belief in continuous learning drives me to constantly expand my skill set, and I always seek opportunities to both learn from others and impart my knowledge onto others.

On this website, you will find a collection of articles authored by me, covering various topics such as DevOps, Cloud, and Linux. Additionally, you will find docs or writeups for various open source projects of mine.

*Thanks for visiting!*
