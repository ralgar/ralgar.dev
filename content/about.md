I am *Ryan Algar* - a highly motivated, self-taught programmer and Linux
 sysadmin who specializes in Cloud Native technologies and DevOps methodology.
 While I hold formal education in *Network Administration and Cybersecurity*,
 my passion for continuous learning has driven me to cultivate much of my
 expertise independently, with a focus on practical, hands-on experience.

I am particularly enthusiastic about automation tools and actively engage in
 the open source community, regularly contributing to a variety of projects.
 My strong desire for continuous learning drives me to constantly expand my
 skill set, and I always seek opportunities to both learn from others and share
 my acquired knowledge.

On this website, you will find a collection of articles authored by me,
 covering various topics such as DevOps, Cloud, Cybersecurity, and Programming.
 Additionally, you will find links to documentation for some of my more
 noteworthy open source projects.

*Thanks for visiting!*
